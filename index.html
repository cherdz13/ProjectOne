        <p>I'm from East Los Angeles, I have two orange cats. They are calm but very chatoic it's fun to see them play and intereact with bugs. I have a dog named rocky, both cats don't like how clingy and rough he can be with them.My favorite colors are green and burgundy, I also have a wide amount of interests. But I love being creative and having the liberty to express myself.</p>
